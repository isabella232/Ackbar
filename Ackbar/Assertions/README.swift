 In order to override Swift's native assertions, you must manually drag and drop
 my sibling, Assertions.swift, into your targets:
 
 Option 1:
 - Locate this file in the Project Navigator, by ⌘+⇧+J or Navigate > Reveal in Project Navigator
 - Drag "Assertions.swift" from that directory into your main project.
 - Add "Assertions.swift" to each target where you want to replace Swift assertions.
 
 Option 2:
 - Locate this file in Finder, by right-clicking on this file and selecting "Show in Finder".
 - Drag "Assertions.swift" from that directory into your main project.
