 * Only compile these assertion replacements into DEBUG or COCOAPODS builds.

 * When compiling into your app, we only want these assertions to override the 
 * system assertions in DEBUG builds. Some crash reporters get confused when the
 * top entry in the stack is shared across multiple crashes which ends up 
 * rolling up otherwise unrelated issues into a single issue.
 *
 * When compiling into a CocoaPod framework, these assertions can be built right
 * into the framework because they will be namespaced and not override the 
 * system assertions.
